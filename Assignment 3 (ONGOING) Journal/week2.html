    <h1> WEEK 2 </h1>
    <p>In today's class, the teacher showed us some early websites that played an important role in promoting the early stages of the Internet. This provided me with an opportunity to gain an in-depth understanding of the development of the Internet.

        In class, the teacher explained the specific requirements of ASSIGNMENT 1 in detail, which gave me a clearer understanding of how to complete ASSIGNMENT 1. I can create more targeted planning and design in my next work.
        
        During today's learning process, I realized that web design is far more than just the presentation of appearance, but also needs to pay attention to the actual needs of users. What is particularly interesting is that the teacher introduced a practical tool for user inclusion. Through a simple use experience, I began to have a preliminary understanding of the diversity and needs of users. This tool not only allowed me to better build user personas, but also analyze their needs more deeply to better meet their expectations.
        
        As a designer, todayâ€™s lesson had a profound impact on me. I realized that the needs and backgrounds of different users must be fully considered during the design process. I also understand better that web design is not just about visual presentation, but more importantly about achieving specific goals and providing an excellent user experience. This realization will inspire me to pay more attention to user needs in future design work and create more inclusive, practical and valuable web design works.</p>
