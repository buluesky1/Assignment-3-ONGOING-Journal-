    <h1> WEEK 10 </h1>
    <p>In assignment 2.2, I have made some progress. First I have selected a CMS platform and host to meet the needs of my project. Then, I searched for some basic instructional videos and studied. I increased my proficiency in the chosen CMS platform and learned how to add, edit and manage content. In addition, while designing the web page, I conducted some tests to ensure that the web page functions properly.

        Overall, Assignment 2.2 went well and I have built a website framework that meets the project requirements. Next, I will continue to refine the content and ensure that the website matches the design of my figma.</p>
