    <h1> WEEK 3 </h1>
    <p>In today's class, the teacher introduced us to the development history of network design from 1998 to 2008. During this period, I learned about the development of skeuomorphic design, which is a design concept that aims to make elements on web pages more similar to objects in the real world, helping users better understand how to use the new interface.

        Additionally, we dive into the importance of design goals in web design, specifically how to set them up successfully. Successful design needs to take into account user experience, aesthetics, and practical goal achievement. More, the teacher also introduced the important graphical tool of Venn diagram, which uses overlapping circles to show the relationship between different goals.
        
        During today's study, I became very interested in skeuomorphic design in the development of network design from 1998 to 2008. In addition, I learned that successful design requires support from both qualitative and quantitative goals. This knowledge will have a positive impact on my future web design work, allowing me to better understand and apply different design concepts and goals to create a better experience for users.</p>
