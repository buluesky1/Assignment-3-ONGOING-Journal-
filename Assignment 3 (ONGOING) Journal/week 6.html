    <h1> WEEK 6 </h1>
    <p>In today's class, I learned a lot of useful information about web design. First, the teacher introduced us to a website that features a hidden drop-down bar. This design approach presents content on the page more elegantly and provides a better user experience.

        In addition, the teacher introduced the requirements of assignment 2 in detail and elaborated on the steps and methods of the design process. We learned how to choose an appropriate color scheme and how to conduct accessibility testing to ensure that the color scheme complies with regulations. You also learned how to choose appropriate fonts and typography to make your web pages more readable and attractive.
        
        In class, I discovered many interesting aspects of web design, especially the design of hidden drop-down bars and the choice of color schemes. These details can add creativity and appeal to web design, providing users with a better browsing experience.
        
        As a designer, todayâ€™s lesson had a profound impact on me. I will pay more attention to detail, especially in color matching and font selection, to ensure that my design is both beautiful and easy to use. At the same time, I will use the skills I have learned to create more attractive and unique web designs that meet user expectations and enhance user experience.</p>
