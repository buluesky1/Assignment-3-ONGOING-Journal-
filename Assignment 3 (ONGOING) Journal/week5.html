    <h1> WEEK 5 </h1>
    <p>In today's class, I learned about the application of bootstrap animation and scroll bars in website design. The teacher showed us a website with guided animations and blending bars, emphasizing how these elements can enhance the user experience and attract the user's attention.

        In addition, the teacher also introduced the submission format of Project 1 and explained in detail how we need to prepare and submit the project.
        
        In class, I discovered the practical applications of bootstrap animations and scrollbars in website design and their importance for user interaction. These elements can help direct users' attention and allow them to navigate the website content more smoothly. In my web design, I can consider how to use these elements skillfully to enhance the user experience and the attractiveness of the interface.
        
        As a designer, todayâ€™s lesson will influence me to think more deeply about user experience and interface design. I will focus more on guiding users in the design, providing a smooth interactive experience, and grabbing the user's attention through engaging animations and elements. This will make my designs more creative and attractive, creating a better browsing and usage experience for users.</p>
