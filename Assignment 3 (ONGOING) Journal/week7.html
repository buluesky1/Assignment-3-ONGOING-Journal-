    <h1> WEEK 7 </h1>
    <p>This week's class introduces some key concepts in web design. First, the teacher showed us a fascinating interactive website that allowed pictures to change on mouse hover. This interactivity grabs the userâ€™s attention and allows them to explore the page content more deeply. Next, we learned about web page layout, including grids, visual hierarchy, color & typography, scale, white space and balance. These are the basic principles necessary to build a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate web page. I learned how to use these principles to create a user-friendly interface to ensure that visitors can easily navigate the content on your website.

        The most interesting discovery this week was how these principles of web design impact user experience. With proper visual hierarchy, the designer can direct the user's attention to where I want them to focus. This is crucial for creating attractive web pages.
        
        I plan to apply these principles to my upcoming web design project. I use grids to ensure a consistent layout of page elements, visual hierarchy to highlight important content, color & typography to convey brand messaging, and Balance and White Space to provide the overall balance of the page.
        
        
        This course had a profound impact on me as a web designer. I realized that design is not just about aesthetics, but also about user experience. In future designs, I will pay more attention to affordances and call to action to ensure that users can easily interact with the website. These concepts will help me design a more attractive and usable website, increasing user satisfaction.
        
        In addition, the teacher also reviewed the requirements of assignment 2.1 submission, which gave me a better understanding of the goals and expectations of the project, which will help me complete my homework.</p>
