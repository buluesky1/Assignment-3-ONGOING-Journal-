    <h1> WEEK 8 </h1>
    <p>In this week's class, the teacher showed us a very interesting interactive website, in which the text on the page changes shades when the user scrolls the mouse. This effect gives users a new way to interact with content, making the website more engaging.

        This week’s discovery is that interaction design can significantly improve user engagement. By changing the darkness of text as they scroll, users can explore the page content more deeply, which is great for capturing their interest.
        
        This week’s class made me pay more attention to the importance of interaction design. User experience is not just a single form, but can be improved in various ways. I hope to be able to apply this newfound knowledge to my design work to provide users with a better experience.
        
        In addition, the teacher also reviewed the requirements of assignment 2.2 web design project coding and CMS, reminding us what we need to pay attention to in these two projects. The websites that can be used in these two projects are summarized again, which helps us clarify the direction and goals of the project.
        
        This week's course not only enriched my design knowledge, but also stimulated my interest in interactive design.</p>
