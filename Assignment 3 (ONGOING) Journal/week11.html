    <h1> WEEK 11 </h1>
    <p>After all the coding lectures, I got a rough idea of coding for web pages. I feel that coding is a powerful tool that can be used to realize all kinds of creative ideas and solve problems. By learning to code, I've picked up a few programming languages and techniques that allow me to create simple web pages. I also realize that coding is an area of constant learning and growth, so I plan to continue learning more and exploring new programming languages and techniques to continually improve my skill level.

        In addition, the coding lecture gave me a solid foundation in web design coding, which played a crucial role in further in-depth web design learning in the future.
        
        Overall, the coding talks were beginner-friendly and the course served its purpose. Novices can make a simple website after completing the instructional video. I hope to make websites with interesting interactions in the future.</p>
