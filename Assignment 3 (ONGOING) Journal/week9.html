    <h1> WEEK 9 </h1>
    <p>This week's class showcases a creative, interactive website that emphasizes the interactive design of buttons and images. This form of interaction allows users to interact more actively with the website and enhances the user experience. In particular, the design of this two-layered page intrigued me, as it shows how complex visual effects can be created through different layers of elements.

        My most interesting discovery was the two-layer page design. The transparent layer and the photo underneath combine to create a unique and attractive effect. I like this design very much, it is simple but gives the design a sense of hierarchy.
        
        The teacher also introduced the concepts of responsive design, breakpoints, and typography, which are very important for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes. The teacher reminded us to design according to the requirements of assignment 2.2 responsive design and conduct testing to ensure that the website performs well on different devices. Additionally, the teacher emphasized the importance of file organization and how to compress images to improve website performance.
        
        In addition, the teacher also taught the concept of alt text, which is crucial for website accessibility to ensure that users of different abilities can understand the content of the image. This knowledge will have an important guiding role in my future web design work.
        
        This weekâ€™s course further sharpened my creative thinking and allowed me to understand that there are endless possibilities in web design. At the same time, I learned about the design requirements of assignment 2.2 responsive design. This website that compresses images is exactly what I need.</p>
