    <h1> WEEK 1 </h1>
    <p>In today's class, the teacher first introduced us to the teacher team of this course and briefly outlined the main content covering Project 1 to Project 3. Subsequently, the course conducted a session called "ICE BREAKER", through which everyone designed a name tag for personal introduction.

        Through today's class, I have a preliminary understanding of the overall structure of the course and the requirements for subsequent projects. At the same time, through the "ICE BREAKER" session, I also met other students and showed off my design capabilities and personal information in a relaxed atmosphere. This link not only helps students understand each other, but also lays the foundation for future cooperation and interaction in the classroom.</p>
