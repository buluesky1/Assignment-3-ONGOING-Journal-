    <h1> WEEK 4 </h1>
    <p>In today's class, I learned about website design with interactive patterns. The teacher also introduced us to the development history of website design from 2009 to the present, showing the changes and innovations in design trends during this period.

        In class, the teacher explained the concepts of user journey maps and user flow charts in detail, and gave an in-depth introduction to how to make these charts. These charts can help designers better understand user behavior and experience on the website, so they can design more targetedly.
        
        In addition, the teacher also reviewed the requirements of Project 1 and emphasized the importance and precautions in the design process.
        
        In today's class, I discovered the importance of interactivity in website design, and the guiding role of user journey maps and user flow charts in the design process. This knowledge will have practical application for me in web design. As a designer, I will be able to better understand user needs, create more attractive and user-friendly designs, and pay more attention to user experience and interactivity during the design process.</p>
