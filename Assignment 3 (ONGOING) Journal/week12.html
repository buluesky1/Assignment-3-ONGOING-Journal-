    <h1> WEEK 12 </h1>
    <p>I am very excited and positive about this course. In the class, I learned a lot about web design and coding, including web layout, interactive design, responsive design, CMS production, etc. This knowledge not only enriched my skills but also enhanced my interest in the field of web design.

        I especially like the various interactive websites and web design cases introduced by the teacher. These examples help me better understand the interactivity between websites and users and stimulate my creativity.
        
        In addition, the course also focused on practical application of projects, which allowed me to apply the knowledge I learned to actual web design projects, which was very important for improving my practical skills.
        
        Overall, this course provided me with a well-rounded education in web design and coding, and I am very much looking forward to applying what I learned in future projects, while also continuing to learn and grow further.</p>
